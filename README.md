**Ethiopia to Kenya power interconnection project**
#
This project, which is being developed jointly by the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo) and the Kenya Electricity Transmission Company Limited (KETRACO), aims to construct a high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line of over 1,000 km from Wolayta-Sodo in Ethiopia to Longonot in Kenya. The transmission line, with an eventual capacity of 2,000 MW, will evacuate power from Ethiopia that will be predominantly generated from hydropower sources to displace electricity that would have been generated mainly from fossil fuels in Kenya. The project will lead to an annual reduction of approximately 3.5 million tonnes of CO2 per year during the first year of operation, which will increase to over 7 million tonnes of CO2 per year after 4 years. It will be the largest CDM project in Africa in terms of emission reductions achieved.

**Ithezi-Tezhi hydropower project in Zambia**
The project consists of constructing and operating a 120 MW hydropower plant at the existing Itezhi Tezhi dam on the Kafue River in Zambia, with associated ancillary equipment and structures. Power will be generated using the head available at the existing dam. Therefore, there will be no construction of a new dam and the average generation output is estimated at 611 GWh per year. The project activity will also include construction of a transmission line of about 300 km to evacuate power from the plant to Lusaka West. 
The transmission line will be connected to the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) grid that is dominated by thermal power plants, and will therefore displace electricity that is currently generated using a large proportion of fossil fuels, with electricity generated from clean and renewable sources. The project is expected to be the first CDM project to make use of the SAPP regional grid emission factor, and will result in greenhouse gas emission reductions of over 560,000 tCO2/year.

**Lagos Cable Propelled Transit Project**
Lagos is a rapidly growing megacity with over 16 million inhabitants, with population projections estimating that the city will become the world’s third largest urban agglomeration in the near future. The existing roadway infrastructure is already close to breaking point as it is choked with unbearable levels of traffic. There is, therefore, a strong need for better public transport in the city. The project involves the construction of three Cable Propelled Transit (CPT) systems for mass transit in Lagos that will link Lagos Island and Lagos mainland as well as residential and business areas of the city. The CPT will improve transport in Lagos by reducing traffic congestion, especially during rush hour, and will reduce emissions by an estimated 90,000 tCO2/year once all three lines are built.

**Windiga Solar PV Project**
The objective of the project is to build and operate the first large-scale solar photovoltaic powerplant in Burkina Faso. The 22 MW power plant will be connected to the national grid and become the largest solar power plant in sub-Saharan Africa. The project is located in the community of Zina in the province of “La Boucle du Mouhoun”, 200 km west of Ouagadougou, the nation’s capital. The energy expected to be delivered is about 33 000 MWh. The project contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions as it produces electricity from a renewable source and thus displaces fossil fuel- based grid electricity generation. More specifically, it is expected to reduce emissions by approximately 23,000 tCO2/year.

**Durban Municipal Solid Waste Project**
The Durban Municipal Solid Waste Project is a gas collection system at the Mariannhill landfill in Durban. The project uses some of the recovered gas to generate renewable energy; this is, in turn, fed to the municipal grid to replace electricity based on fossil fuels. The World Bank Group’s Prototype Carbon Fund will purchase approximately 337,000 carbon credits from the project.
The Durban Municipal Solid Waste Project was the first of its kind to be registered in Africa under the Clean Development Mechanism. The project is being implemented by Durban Solid Waste (DSW), which is the municipal solid waste department of eThekwini Municipality. The electricity produced from the landfill gas is sold to the municipal electricity department. The Mariannhill landfill was declared a National Conservancy Site in 2004, the first time a landfill, has been incorporated into an ecosystem restoration site.

**Olkaria II Unit 3 Geothermal Project**
By adding a third (35 MW) generator to an existing geothermal plant, the Olkaria II Unit 3 Geothermal Project is expanding Kenya’s renewable energy capacity and contributing about 276 GWh annually to greening the national grid. Located 132 km northwest of Nairobi, the geothermal plant is owned and operated by the Kenya Electricity Generating Company Limited (KenGen). 
This geothermal expansion project is earning carbon credits under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). It is reducing the equivalent of 149,632 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) per year by displacing thermal electricity that would otherwise be generated by fossil fuels. The project was registered with the UNFCCC in December 2010; the World Bank’s Community Development Carbon Fund is purchasing about 480,000 carbon credits from it.
The project is also using part of the carbon revenue to finance a community benefit plan (CBP) to help poor communities living close to the geothermal plant who depend mainly on farming and livestock. The CBP, designed to address priority needs, was developed in consultation with the beneficiary communities, KenGen, regional chiefs, and local councils.

**Landfill gas capture and utilization program**
The Morocco Landfills’ Gas Capture, Flaring and Use Program avoids methane emissions at a number of new or rehabilitated landfills by capturing the biogas produced by solid waste. The program promotes the flaring or use of landfill gas (LFG) for energy production.
The Fonds d’Equipement Communal, Morocco’s municipal development bank, will develop and manage the activities. The municipalities participating in the program will either construct and operate the project themselves or contract it out to the private sector.
In addition to methane, the program will reduce carbon dioxide emissions in Morocco by displacing the production of electricity or heat energy based on fossil fuels.
This Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Program of Activities will generate about 1 million carbon credits by 2020 and will sell these to the World Bank’s Carbon Partnership Facility (CPF). The program is expected to reduce emissions and generate carbon credits beyond 2020 as well.

**The Electrogaz Compact Fluorescent Lamp Distribution Project**
The Electrogaz Compact Fluorescent Lamp Distribution Project distributes high efficiency and high quality compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) to urban and rural residents across Rwanda as part of the national electrification program.
This project targets both new customers and those already connected to the power grid. It helps clients lower their electricity costs by replacing traditional light bulbs; it also includes an education component to teach them to use electricity more efficiently.
The CFL distribution project was executed in several phases through decentralized outlets run by the Rwanda Energy Group (formerly Electrogaz). A total of 800,000 CFL bulbs have been distributed over the past eight years, reducing emissions by the equivalent of 21,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year. The World Bank’s Community Development Carbon Fund is supporting the project by buying 130,000 of the carbon credits generated.

**Egypt Vehicle Scrapping and Recycling Program of Activities**
The Egyptian mass transport fleet is aging; in fact, the average taxi in Egypt had until recently been on the road for 32 years. Aging fleets are prone to frequent breakdowns and high emissions because older vehicles are typically not equipped with modern catalytic converters. 
The Egypt Vehicle Scrapping and Recycling Program of Activities (PoA) is part of a national program whereby owners of taxis, buses, microbuses, and trailer trucks voluntarily surrender their vehicles for managed scrapping and recycling in exchange for financial incentives that may be used toward the purchase of new vehicles. The scrapping and recycling program is currently limited to taxi vehicles in the Greater Cairo Region, but may expand to other regions and vehicle types. 
The eligible vehicles are those covered by Traffic Law #121 (enacted in 2008), which states that owners of mass transport vehicles older than 20 years are not eligible for new operating licenses or license renewals. The law was designed to accelerate fleet replacement in order to improve air quality (including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions) and to reduce the number of traffic accidents involving older vehicles.
